# ECMA-48 Progress/Compliance

## Reference documents

* [ECMA-6 7-Bit coded Character Set](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-006.pdf)

This document explains the formatting of the 7-bit characters used throughout most other documents. Instead of
simply calling it ASCII, in 1965 it was probably better to just call it whatever at the time. There is much
in here which is obviously highly obsolete, but there are many gems throughout the document which make it worthwhile.

* [ECMA-7 Representation of the Standard ECMA-6 (7 bit Code) on Punched Cards](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-7,%201st%20Edition,%20April%201965.pdf)

This document is truly and oddity. Its purpose was to define how to use punch cards to represent characters. But to fully
understand the crazy 1/11 type of notation instead of purely 0x1B type of hexadecimal, this document clarifies it by making
it possible to choose column and rows on punch cards. I was so embarressed when I finally realized that all these old standards
were thinking in terms of rows and columns as opposed to hex ... and this was a huge issue for me because I never figured out
that 1/11 was what they did before hex. So I had not idea 1/11 was 0x1B.

* [ECMA-16](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-16,%202nd%20Edition,%20June%201973.pdf)

This document is considered to be roughly similar to [ISO 1745:1975](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1745:ed-1:v1:en) which
describes the functions of the C0 character set (stuff like line feed and form feed). It is likely complete enough to use as a
substitute for ISO 1745.

* [ECMA-48](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf)

This is the document forming the premise of this document. It is the foundation for identifying how far VtNetCore has come
in standards compliance with ECMA.

### Notes / Issues

#### 8.3.5 BS - BACKSPACE

> BS causes the active data position to be moved one character position in the data component in the direction opposite to that of the implicit movement.
>
> The direction of the implicit movement depends on the parameter value of SELECT IMPLICIT
MOVEMENT DIRECTION (SIMD). 

TODO : As SIMD is not implemented, the cursor direction will always be leftward. (complexity high)

#### 8.3.6 CAN - CANCEL

> CAN is used to indicate that the data preceding it in the data stream is in error. As a result, this data shall be ignored. The specific meaning of this control function shall be defined for each application and/or between sender and recipient.

TODO : Implement this in the sequence parser. (complexity, possibly high)

#### 8.3.8 CCH - CANCEL CHARACTER

> CCH is used to indicate that both the preceding graphic character in the data stream, (represented by one or more bit combinations) including SPACE, and the control function CCH itself are to be ignored for further interpretation of the data stream.
>
> If the character preceding CCH in the data stream is a control function (represented by one or more bit combinations), the effect of CCH is not defined by this Standard.

TODO : Consider implementation in sequence parser (complexity, possibly high)

#### 8.3.11 CMD - CODING METHOD DELIMITER

> CMD is used as the delimiter of a string of data coded according to Standard ECMA-35 and to switch > to a general level of control.
>
> The use of CMD is not mandatory if the higher level protocol defines means of delimiting the string, for instance, by specifying the length of the string.

TODO : Consider implementing.

#### 8.3.14 CPR - ACTIVE POSITION REPORT

> If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION, CPR is used to report the > active presentation position of the sending device as residing in the presentation component at the n-th line position according to the line progression and at the m-th character position > according to the character path, where n equals the value of Pn1 and m equals the value of Pn2.
>
> If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, CPR is used to report the active data position of the sending device as residing in the data component at the n-th line > position according to the line progression and at the m-th character position according to the > character progression, where n equals the value of Pn1 and m equals the value of Pn2.
>
> CPR may be solicited by a DEVICE STATUS REPORT (DSR) or be sent unsolicited.

TODO : MUST implement!!! (complexity medium/high)

#### 8.3.16 CSI - CONTROL SEQUENCE INTRODUCER

> CSI is used as the first character of a control sequence, see 5.4.

TODO : MUST implement 0x9B (for 8-bit) (complexity, minimal)

#### 8.3.17 CTC - CURSOR TABULATION CONTROL

> CTC causes one or more tabulation stops to be set or cleared in the presentation component, > depending on the parameter values:
>
> 0) a character tabulation stop is set at the active presentation position
> 1) a line tabulation stop is set at the active line (the line that contains the active > presentation position)
> 2) the character tabulation stop at the active presentation position is cleared
> 3) the line tabulation stop at the active line is cleared
> 4) all character tabulation stops in the active line are cleared
> 5) all character tabulation stops are cleared
> 6) all line tabulation stops are cleared
>
> In the case of parameter values 0, 2 or 4 the number of lines affected depends on the setting of the TABULATION STOP MODE (TSM).

TODO : Consider implementing (complexity simple but a lot of conditions)

#### 8.3.23 CVT - CURSOR LINE TABULATION

> CVT causes the active presentation position to be moved to the corresponding character position of the line corresponding to the n-th following line tabulation stop in the presentation component, where n equals the value of Pn.

TODO : Consider implementing (complexity pretty simple)

#### 8.3.25 DAQ - DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION

SEE : Standard, too much to copy here

TODO : Implement (complexity medium, but many conditions)

#### 8.3.27 DCS - DEVICE CONTROL STRING

> DCS is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for device control use. The command string following may consist of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. The control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST).
>
> The command string represents either one or more commands for the receiving device, or one or more status reports from the sending device. The purpose and the format of the command string are specified by the most recent occurrence of IDENTIFY DEVICE CONTROL STRING (IDCS), if any, or depend on the sending and/or the receiving device.

TODO : Consider implementing (complexity, TBD)

#### 8.3.34 DMI - DISABLE MANUAL INPUT

Currently only mode 4 and 20 are implemented.

TODO : Look more into whether this is interesting. I've implemented ST, but I don't know whether SOS is
meaningful.

Clearly printing related and REALLY REALLY never going to be interesting

Most likely won't implement.

#### 8.3.137 SRS - START REVERSED STRING

[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)

No point wasting time on this. Pretty sure I have given up on bidi support by now.

Not sure whether this has value. Will consider.

Pretty sure this is printing related and of value for making things pretty. I'm not sure whether this
has value in my program.

#### 8.3.144 STAB - SELECTIVE TABULATION

TODO : Get a copy of ISO 8613-6 and identify whether this is interesting

I'm not sure whether this is something which needs to be implemented. I'm pretty sure this is meant as a
function of the font.

#### 8.3.149 SVS - SELECT LINE SPACING

Seems to be very printing related. Will skip this for now.

TODO : Refer to ISO 1745. This seems to be the way I may be able to make keep-alive happen.

#### 8.3.151 TAC - TABULATION ALIGNED CENTRED

> TAC causes a character tabulation stop calling for centring to be set at character position n in the active

Most likely won't implement this unless there's a reason to do so.

#### 8.3.152 TALE - TABULATION ALIGNED LEADING EDGE

> TALE causes a character tabulation stop calling for leading edge alignment to be set at character
> position n in the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and lines of

> 
> A text string aligned with a tabulation stop set by TALE will be positioned so that the (leading edge of

Most likely won't implement this unless there's a reason to do so.

#### 8.3.153 TATE - TABULATION ALIGNED TRAILING EDGE

> TATE causes a character tabulation stop calling for trailing edge alignment to be set at character
> position n in the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and lines of

> 
> A text string aligned with a tabulation stop set by TATE will be positioned so that the (trailing edge of

Most likely won't implement this unless there's a reason to do so.

#### 8.3.154 TBC - TABULATION CLEAR

> TBC causes one or more tabulation stops in the presentation component to be cleared, depending on the
> parameter value:
> 
> 0) the character tabulation stop at the active presentation position is cleared
> 1) the line tabulation stop at the active line is cleared

> 5) all tabulation stops are cleared
> 
> In the case of parameter value 0 or 2 the number of lines affected depends on the setting of the

Currently modes 0 and 3 are implemented.

TODO : Implement modes 1 and 2, possibly 4 and 5. I'm seeing 1 and 2 when running some software and some tests.

#### 8.3.155 TCC - TABULATION CENTRED ON CHARACTER

> TCC causes a character tabulation stop calling for alignment of a target graphic character to be set at
> character position n in the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and lines of

Most likely won't implement this. Some of these features seem to be really focused on echo mode and I don't see
local echo as a priority.

#### 8.3.156 TSR - TABULATION STOP REMOVE

> TSR causes any character tabulation stop at character position n in the active line (the line that contains
> the active presentation position) and lines of subsequent text in the presentation component to be
> cleared, but does not affect other tabulation stops. n equals the value of Pn.

I'm not sure I could find a proper test case to verify I got this working. Besides, it seems to be printer head
motion related as opposed to screen related.

#### 8.3.157 TSS - THIN SPACE SPECIFICATION

Most likely won't implement as it seems strictly printing related.

#### 8.3.162 VTS - LINE TABULATION SET

> VTS causes a line tabulation stop to be set at the active line (the line that contains the active presentation
> position). 

TODO : Seems interesting as it is cursor movement, but I don't want to waste a lot of time implementing vertical tabs.
